                Figure 5- East view of the four-sided scaffold used to lift the stone blocks to the construction plateau. The top rollers are positioned to lift the load clear of the plateau. The bottom rollers position the hauling ropes for a level pull.

                On the plateau, four teams of workers (Figure 6) then pulled in unison and hoisted the sledge up the vertical shaft. It is estimated that a total of 40 men, divided into four hauling teams, would be able to lift a 2 ton load to the plateau at a velocity of 30m per minute. With a simple ratchet device on each of the lower rollers, the teams could haul in stages, releasing most of the tension on the hauling ropes as they repositioned themselves for the next pull. This feature would have been especially useful when the area of the plateau diminished at the higher elevations. When the sledge cleared the surface of the plateau, two or more wooden beams spanning the shaft were then placed under the sledge, so that it could be skidded away from the shaft and onto the work area. The hook was then let down the shaft to fetch the next sledge. As each tier of stones was added, the scaffold was levered up to the new plateau.
